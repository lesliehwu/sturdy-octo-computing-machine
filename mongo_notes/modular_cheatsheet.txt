server.js
- always start with your server.js file
- the server.js file acts as the home base for your application
- this is where you require the routes and the mongoose configurations
- the server.js also creates the express application, loads configurations onto it, and then tells it to listen

server/config/routes.js
- this is the file that specifies which routes will be handled and by which controller methods
- from routes.js we require the controller file (or files)

server/config/mongoose.js
- this is the file that connects to the database and loads all of the models
- here we specify a database to connect to and the path where all of our models are
- this file is required by server.js

server/controllers/quotes.js
- this is the file that handles all of the server-side logic
- the controller is called upon by routes
- the controller interacts with preloaded models to run database commands
- the controller sends the response to the client
- there can be many controllers in the server/controllers folder

server/models/quote.js
- this is the file that specifies the schema to be loaded by mongoose
- this file is required by mongoose.js
- we do not need to require this file in the controller, instead the model itself is loaded from mongoose
- there can be many models in the server/models folder
